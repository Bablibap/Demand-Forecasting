# Background & Problem
A joint study carried out by a retail analytics firm, Dynamic Action, revealed that under stocking in retail stores account for approximately USD 631.4 billion  in lost sales. The study also showed that overstocking leads  to $ 471.9 billion  in lost sales. On average, the retail industry incurs a whooping loss of USD 1.75 trillion  in failing to forecast their demands correctly. 
# Project
The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model that predicts the demand of all items one week into the future in the most efficient way. Given inputs such as:
1. Week of the transaction
2. Customer who bought the product
3. Warehouse the product shipped from (for the particular customer,
4. Price of each item

A model was developed that predicts the demand of each product, for each customer at each of the warehouses.
# Impact & Results
The model is accurately able to predict the demand of all products simultaneously. This saves time. Additionally, with accurate demand predictions, the number of returns reduces, reducing cost. The cost of not meeting demand due to understocking is also reduced.
